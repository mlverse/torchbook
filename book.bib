 abstract={A dataset of dimensions 343 {\texttimes} 179 consisting of CO2 emissions from CDP (187 cities, few in developing countries), the Bonn Center for Local Climate Action and Reporting (73 cities, mainly in developing countries), and data collected by Peking University (83 cities in China). Further, a set of socio-economic variables {\textendash} called ancillary data {\textendash} were collected from other datasets (e.g. socio-economic and traffic indices) or calculated (climate indices, urban area expansion), then combined with the emission data. The remaining attributes are descriptive (e.g. city name, country, etc.) or related to quality assurance/control checks. Please open using Tab as separator and " as text delimiter.},
